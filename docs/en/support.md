Like any service, it is resource intensive, and it will always cost someone money, the more users we have, the more it costs. As a result, after a certain level, we can't afford to operate out of our own pockets because of the increasing number of individual demands and telecom problems that arise.

Besides, it has long been suggested that you support our work in one way or another, the easiest way to do this as a user is to support us financially.

You can do this on our [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fxtelekom) page.

!!! INFO

    If you have free resources and you would like to make them available to us: we cannot accept it because we do not handle it 100% and we do not want to inconvenience anyone in case of any failure. If you do want to support us with a server, you can do so for the price of a server as a monthly sponsor (you can see exactly what this is on our kofi page).

Of course, we are very grateful to everyone who contributes to the project, so we have set up a plan to make sure that the support benefits everyone. Of course, this list will grow in the future.
