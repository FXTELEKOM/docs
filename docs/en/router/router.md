## Setup on routers
!!! INFO "Advanced content!"

    If you don't have any of the hardware or software listed in this category, and/or don't know what it's about and don't care, in which case this doesn't apply to you! Otherwise, have fun!

If you have a Wireguard capable router, or have a spare machine/other resource that you would like to try out a router os or network operating system on, even as an experiment, you've come to the right place! You can use one of these to set up a VPN at network level, which means you don't need to do anything on your devices, and it will work on consoles, TVs and other IoT devices too.

!!! INFO

    If you have a Wireguard capable device that is not on our list, please report it on discord! We try to cover as wide range as possible, but we can't know everything.
