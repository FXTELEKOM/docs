# Information about the problem
If you're here, you've probably noticed that there are a lot of sites and games that are not accessible on Telekom's network. You've probably also heard the news that DTAG, alias the German Telekom, has been unable to reach an agreement with Cloudflare for years, or that Meta has disconnected from their network.

## The root of the problem
The aforementioned things are happening because DTAG has made it a business issue whether other operators are directly connected to their network, thus the services that are not included will be mostly unusable from Telekom's network, all because DTAG can make more money from a subscription model than from satisfied customers. For a giant company, numbers are often more important than the value created.

## Where is the solution?
There have been previous instances where the company has been sued, and there are ongoing complaints from the public, but this is not considered a success, as money can solve everything, which DTAG has ðŸ™‚.

Of course, if they wanted to, they could solve it, but they don't want to, so there is nothing left but a community solution, which is what we are trying to do.

As you read in the introduction: it's a VPN. The question arises whether other VPNs can solve the problem. The answer is yes. If you have the necessary knowledge, you can find a VPS that is on the DTAG network and create one yourself. Business VPNs such as Proton or Nord will not work because the hosting they are on(M247, and this is true of most VPNs, you should look at Datapacket) also does not peer with DTAG. Many places write about Cloudflare WARP as a possible solution, we used to suggest it too, but it's not reliable either, so the obvious solution is us!
