# Introduction

Welcome to the FXTELEKOM documentation!
We offer a solution to your Telekom routing problems in the form of a selective VPN based on Wireguard.
This means that only the problematic services that we support go through our servers.

!!! INFO "Important!"

    Our community is centered on our Discord server, and that's where we'll keep everyone updated, so you should at least keep an eye out for [`#changelog`]() (Updates about the service) and [`#frissítések`]() (Updates about the community) rooms!

!!! DANGER "This one too!"

    If you quit the server, we'll assume that you're not interested or not affected by the service, and your config (if any) will be deleted!
