# Setup

## Saving the config
Once you have successfully installed the Wireguard client, all you have to do is download and activate the config.

Open a notepad or a code editor of your choice! Copy and paste the config you received earlier! "File" --> "Save As" or `ctrl+s`! In the file type, select "all files" and save it to a location of your choice, with a name of your choice, but make sure to add `.conf` at the end of the filename!

When you see the green dot and the `Active` sign, the VPN is active, you can close the window and enjoy fast internet! ðŸ˜Ž
