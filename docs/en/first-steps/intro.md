# First steps

Before you get started, it's important to clarify a few things:

* We don't want you to get your hopes up, so first of all, read [what services we currently support](../../other/services)!
* Join to [our Discord!](https://discord.gg/n2WmGaEn3H)

## Config request
Once you're hopped in to Discord, you'll need a unique Wireguard configuration to securely use the services we redirect.

No need to overthink it, just let us know in the [`#beszélgető`]() room that you'd like a config and, as soon as we have a chance, we'll provide one.

The config, because it contains confidential information and we don't want other users to have access to it, will be given in a private room that no one but you and us can see.

The name will be your discord username.

The message and the content of the room will look like this (Real config, censored!):

Go to wireguard installation to continue!
